# ScavengerHunt plugin planned improvements

## No ETA (yet)
* Assign mob objectives check call to onDeathListener
* Assign item objectives check call to somewhere else
* Add language configuration file
* Add option to have multiple scavenges running at once
* Add suport to worldguard
* Add option to allow multiple winners
* Add option to reward differently based on player placing
* Major code overhaul (write pre-existing ideas from scratch, change package, fix attribute and method protection)
* Add reward probabilities

## 1.7.2
* Do something about tools/armor/weapons requiring 100% durability to count toward objectives
* Make a logger class for administrative purposes(ScavengerId, time of start/finish/duration, objectives, rewards, winner)
* Check if saved files (currently using getDisplayName) have any incompatibilities with name-changing plugins.
